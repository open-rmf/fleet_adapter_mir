# Path to nav graph yaml

# ROBOT CONFIG =================================================================
# To init MiR robot REST APIs and RMF states

robots:
  # NOTE(CH3): This robot name is different from the MiR robot name
  # for some reason
  #
  # I don't have access to the MiR REST server to test it out
  # Doesn't seem very configurable from the code side?
  #
  # So for now, this name is the name used in the script only.

        # NOTE(CH3):
        # If you leave these empty, the robot will try to figure it out on init
        # from the MiR reported location.
        #
        # Otherwise, fill BOTH of these! And make sure that the robot starts
        # ON the waypoint!

        orientation: 0.0 # Optional, radians


# NODE CONFIG ==================================================================
# To init the ROS2 node names used in the script

# TRANSFORM CONFIG =============================================================
# For computing transforms between MiR and RMF coordinate systems
#
# NOTE(CH3): I am assuming that the transform is the same across maps
# Otherwise... Future me or future someone else, PLEASE KEY THIS PER MAP
# And also remember to edit the robot.transforms dictionary accordingly!!
