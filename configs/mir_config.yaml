# ROBOT CONFIG =================================================================
# To init MiR robot REST APIs and RMF states

robots:
  # NOTE(CH3): This robot name is different from the MiR robot name
  # for some reason
  #
  # I don't have access to the MiR REST server to test it out
  # Doesn't seem very configurable from the code side?
  #
  # So for now, this name is the name used in the script only.
